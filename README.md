# simple-bing-map

This map uses the latest Bing Maps API. You have to get your own API key from Microsoft's website if you want to make this project to work properly.

Replace [YOUR_BING_MAPS_KEY] with your API key in the code and you are done.

This simple map by the way tracks and follows your location. It is way cooler if you try it on a moving vehicle with a phone.
